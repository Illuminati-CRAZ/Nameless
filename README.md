> üèÜ A high-performance and scalable score submission server for Quaver.

**Quaver** is an actively growing rhythm game which tracks **millions** of scores played by our users. The processing of these scores is quite a heavy job with a **ton** of moving parts. 

We needed a solution that was **performant, scalable, and reliable** - so we built **Nameless.**
